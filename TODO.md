# TODO

[ ] Count amount of `readsegs` in original fastq file (no way to do that later on in processing) for a better `rpkm` score.
[ ] Potentially create a diff (to for example keep only the viruses found in the tumor) or merge the two files in the `csv` so you can see it yourself
[ ] "Remove the ones mapped to phage" (what does xiaowei mean by this??)
[x] Find the virus name based on the loci and annotate output with it (all the top ones can be labeled with Homo â€“ potentially human contigs that were not in the reference sequence, in other words, they were unlikely to be viral)
